 This could have been a dynamic registry, and it was at some point. However, since
 1) the dialogues are now synced one at a time during play rather than at configuration,
 2) dynamic registries can only be reloaded by restarting the server,
 3) codecs give terrible error messages,
 and 4) codecs are inefficient in networking,
 going back to old-time stuff seemed best.
 (still using codecs to a degree, but validation is done separately now)
